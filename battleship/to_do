specs pass

need to attempt bonus

I have the game set to initialize a 10x10 board then prior to playing the game
(at the bottom of battleship.rb) I have the board place 10 random ships
    -Doing it the way that I did prohibits one from initializing a board
    of your choosing(size-wise)
    -So if Board.new is passed an optional size&&board-pieces it will probably
    throw an error b/c I don't have the prog set up to handle that.
