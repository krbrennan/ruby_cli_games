[DONE]  the human_player class needs a better method of displaying the board

[DONE]  there's something amiss in the logic of the game. Occasionally when I win
it'll say "GG, computer wins!" so it's not consistently recognizing whose turn it is.
I think that maybe it's occasionally switching players after I win?
I'm not sure but it needs tweaking.
